# RSS_to_S3
This program sends RSS feed to AWS S3 as json, and creates pre-signed URL.
I wrote this codes for the practical skills exam of an IT company, but maybe it can help you when you create programs related to RSS, S3, json and presigned_url.

I already set up `aws configure` before running this program.
So, if you haven't set up authentication credentials, you should do first.

Please give me your feedback about my codes and English!!

Thanks.
